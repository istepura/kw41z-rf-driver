# kw41z-rf-driver
ARM mbed Nanostack RF driver for NXP KW41Z/21Z 802.15.4 wireless MCU

This driver is used with 6LoWPAN stack. 

Code far from being stable yet, but basic functionality seems to be working. Two FRDM-KW41Z boards running code build from mbed-os-example-mesh-minimal and nanostack-border-router are able to build mesh.
